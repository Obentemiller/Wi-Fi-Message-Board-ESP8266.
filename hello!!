# ESP8266 Message Board

This is a simple ESP8266-based message board that allows users to post and view messages through a web interface. The board creates a Wi-Fi access point with the SSID "acesse 192.168.4.1" and provides a basic chat functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

- `ESP8266WiFi` - ESP8266 WiFi library.
- `ESP8266WebServer` - ESP8266 Web server library.
- `WiFiClient` - ESP8266 WiFi client library.

## Hardware Setup

- You need an ESP8266-based development board, such as the NodeMCU, ESP-12E, or ESP-01.
- Connect the ESP8266 to your computer using a USB-to-Serial converter.
- Flash the code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE or another suitable tool.

## Usage

1. Flash the code to your ESP8266 device.
2. Power up the ESP8266 device, and it will create a Wi-Fi access point named "acesse 192.168.4.1" without a password.
3. Connect to the Wi-Fi network with this SSID.
4. Open a web browser and go to `http://192.168.4.1`.
5. You'll be directed to the chat interface where you can enter your name and start sending and receiving messages.
6. Messages are displayed on the web page with usernames and timestamps.

## Code Explanation

- The code initializes the ESP8266 as a Wi-Fi access point without a password.
- It uses the `ESP8266WebServer` library to handle web requests for the chat interface and message submissions.
- Users can enter their name, send messages, and view the chat log.
- Messages are stored in the `chatLog` variable.
- The code provides a basic chat experience, and it can be extended and improved to fit specific requirements.
